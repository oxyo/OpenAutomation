A lovingly designed and crafted suite of 300+ icons for web and user interface design.

Each icon in the Batch PSD is a single shape layer, meaning they can be scaled up—or down—without loss of quality.

If you use Batch in a Dribbble shot, the inclusion of a “Batch” tag would be appreciated so that I can keep a curated bucket.

I hope you enjoy Batch. I put a lot of time and effort into their design!
