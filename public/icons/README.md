#[Batch](http://adamwhitcroft.com/batch/)

###A lovingly designed and crafted suite of 300 (and counting) icons for web and user interface design by [@adamwhitcroft](https://twitter.com/adamwhitcroft).

Each icon in the Batch PSD is a single shape layer, meaning they can be scaled up&mdash;or down&mdash;without loss of quality.

##Versions

As Batch is a growing resource, it made the most sense to host it on GitHub for the versioning and wiki features. View the [version history here](https://github.com/AdamWhitcroft/Batch/wiki/Version-History).

##License

You are free to use Batch (the "icon set") or any part thereof (the "icons") in any personal, open-source or commercial work without obligation of payment (monetary or otherwise) or attribution. Do not sell the icon set, host the icon set or rent the icon set (either in existing or modified form).

While attribution is optional, it is always appreciated.

Intellectual property rights are not transferred with the download of the icons.

EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL ADAM WHITCROFT BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THE ICONS, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

##Batch Icon-font
