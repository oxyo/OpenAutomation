A bunch of utilities for outputting textual art

Figlet fonts
------------
A slight mod of [Figlet.js](https://github.com/scottgonzalez/figlet-js) which I hope will make it to NPM in pure js form someday, rather than requiring a command line dependency.

Figlet fonts are an ASCII art font standard, widely used for terminal output.

It looks something like this:

    ______                          _ 
    |  _  \                        | |
    | | | |  ___  _ __ ___    ___  | |
    | | | | / _ \| '_ ` _ \  / _ \ | |
    | |/ / |  __/| | | | | || (_) ||_|
    |___/   \___||_| |_| |_| \___/ (_)

To set the directory of the fonts:

    art.Figlet.fontPath = 'Fonts';
        
Then to render some text:

    art.font('my text', 'Doom', function(rendered){
        //do stuff here
    });

Styles
------
ANSI terminals allow us to output style which format the text in the terminal. In order to do this you just need to:

    art.style('my text', 'red+underline');

1. **colors**
Foreground colors for characters are: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white and in some terminal environments:  bright_black, bright_red, bright_green, bright_yellow, bright_blue, bright_magenta, bright_cyan, bright_white (These generally default to their non-bright variants on systems without them)
            
2. **background colors**
Background terminal colors available are: black_bg, red_bg, green_bg, yellow_bg, blue_bg, magenta_bg, cyan_bg, white_bg
        
3. **styles**
To style the text you may use: bold, italic, underline, framed, encircled, overline, blink, inverse
        
4. **controls**
Control styles are: off, hidden

Chaining
--------

The font method also allows you to optionally pass styles and supports chaining, so if I want something a little more complex I could do something like this:

    art.font('Prompt', 'Basic', 'red').font('v1', 'Doom', 'magenta', function(rendered){
        console.log(rendered);
    });

and that will look like this (in color, of course) and it will totally respect the multiline chars and add in ansi codes per line, so things look how you'd expect:

    d8888b. d8888b.  .d88b.  .88b  d88. d8888b. d888888b         __  
    88  `8D 88  `8D .8P  Y8. 88'YbdP`88 88  `8D `~~88~~'        /  | 
    88oodD' 88oobY' 88    88 88  88  88 88oodD'    88    __   __`| | 
    88~~~   88`8b   88    88 88  88  88 88~~~      88    \ \ / / | | 
    88      88 `88. `8b  d8' 88  88  88 88         88     \ V / _| |_
    88      88   YD  `Y88P'  YP  YP  YP 88         YP      \_/  \___/
    
Hope that helps, please report any rough edges!

Enjoy,
